## How to test

You will be guided by voice to solve 3 puzzles that requires to move objects in a room. This will take you about 10 minutes. We will collect anonymous data of the actions you take in the game, in the end we will ask you to fill a form, which will take you about 5 minutes. You will require a space of about 3x3 meters (or 10 x 10 ft.).

If you agree to follow this test continue to these steps:

1. Sideload the APK into the Oculus Quest:
   * Using Powershell (_You must have installed adb_):
   
      Open PowerShell in the folder where the APK is and use the following command:
      
      > adb install -r .\English.apk
      
      You should see a successful install message like this one:
      
      ![](/Docs/ps.png)
   * Using SideQuest:
      
      Open SideQuest App
      ![](/Docs/sidequest1.png)
      
      Drag and drop the apk in the SideQuest app
      ![](/Docs/sidequest2.png)

2. Open the game in the Oculus: Library -> Unknown sources -> PsicoTests2x2English. Please stand more or less in the middle of the room to start the game.

3. In the VR environment, you can see a timestamp on the wall to the right. This is your ID. Please remember it or don't close the test until you have used this number for the next survey as it will be needed to analyze the data of your test.

4. After having tested the software, please fill the following Google Form. This will take you around 5 minutes and will help us understand what we did right and what we did wrong, alongside collecting some data we need for this experiment. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.
